### CI/CD Process

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. The branches below may be present partially or completely.

- **Production Branch**: Code pushed to the `prod` branch will trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which will build and deploy the application to the production environment.
- **Staging Branch**: Code pushed to the `staging` branch will trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which will build and deploy the application to the staging environment.
- **Development Branch**: The `dev` branch is used for development purposes and does not trigger any CI/CD pipeline.

The CI/CD process is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory and includes steps such as checking out the repository, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, building the project, creating a Docker image, and deploying it to the server.
